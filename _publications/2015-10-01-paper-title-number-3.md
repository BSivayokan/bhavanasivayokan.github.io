Introduction: The global prevalence of autism spectrum disorder is rising. However, the services related to autism are only slowly being developed in poor-resource nations. There is a need to understand the characteristics of autistic children in order to develop individualized, evidence-based interventions. This study aims to analyze the sociodemographic profile and initial clinical presentations of autistic children in the northern part of Sri Lanka and determine the differences in these factors between this region and the rest of the country and the globe.
Methods: This retrospective descriptive study in a center for neuro-developmental disorders in Northern Sri Lanka analyzed data extracted from clinical records of 123 autistic children using a predesigned data extraction form. Descriptive analyses and chi-square tests were performed using RStudio.
Results: Among the 123 children, 71.5% were males. The mean age of diagnosis was 3.4 years. Most children (69.9%) had mild to moderate symptoms of autism. At the time of presentation, all children had speech-related complaints, while behavioral issues, poor social interaction, and sensory issues were reported in 91.9%, 96.7%, and 78% respectively. Social stigma was found to be the prime challenge faced by caregivers.
Conclusion: The findings show that speech and language-related problems are universal among autistic children in this region, while behavioral issues, poor social interaction, and sensory issues are highly prevalent. Further, this study highlights the need for community awareness through the primary healthcare system to address delays in detecting red-flag signs of autism by parents and seeking professional help.
