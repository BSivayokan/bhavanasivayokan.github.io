Introduction: The rising proportion of the elderly is increasingly affected by non-communicable diseases. Despite an abundance of literature suggesting that elders with medical conditions are more vulnerable to depression, disability, and cognitive impairment, these tend to go unnoticed and unaddressed. This study describes the prevalence and correlates of depression, disability, and cognitive impairment among elders with medical illnesses attending follow-up clinics in a tertiary care hospital in northern Sri Lanka.
Methods: This descriptive cross-sectional study was carried out among 122 elders (≥60 years) attending medical clinics at Teaching Hospital Jaffna. Depression, disability, and cognitive impairment were assessed by the 15-item Geriatric Depression Scale, 12-item World Health Organization Disability Assessment Schedule 2.0, and Montreal Cognitive Assessment, respectively. Student’s T-Test, ANOVA, and correlation coefficient were used in analyzing data using Statistical Package for Social Sciences 25 (SPSS-v25) (IBM, New York, United States).
Results: The mean age of the participants was 68.3 years (SD=5.70); 58 (47.5%) were males and 64 (52.5%) were females. Prevalence of depression was 44.3% (95% CI=35.5-53.1), while disability was 95.9% (95% CI=92.4-99.4) and cognitive impairment was 80.3% (95% CI=73.2-87.4). Depression was significantly associated with gender (p=0.013), marital status (p=0.019), and living arrangement (p<0.001). Cognitive impairment was significantly associated with education level (p=0.045), and disability was associated with education level (p=0.008) and marital status (p=0.027). Among the study participants, only 12 (9.8%) had previously sought professional help for depression, disability, or cognitive impairment.
Conclusion: Depression, disability, and cognitive impairment are common among the elderly attending medical clinics in Teaching Hospital Jaffna, and are, in most cases, unaddressed.
