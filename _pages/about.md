A graduate student at the Department of Psychological Sciences at Kansas State University. 
<a href="https://orgcentral.k-state.edu/plakkelab/home/" target="_blank" style="text-decoration:none">My lab</a> examines the neurobiology of autism spectrum disorder (ASD) using rodent models of ASD. We are particularly interested in cognitive and behavioral changes across the lifespan. 
My current project focuses on restricted repetitive behavior in fragile X syndrome.

Completed my Bachelor's degree in medical science at the University of Jaffna. 

In my free time, I enjoy reading, hiking, and taking photos.
